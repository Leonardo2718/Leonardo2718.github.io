        <h2 id="about_me">About me</h2>
        <p>I am a software engineering student, studying at the University of Calgary, with a passion for programming, robotics, art and music, learning, and helping others learn. I am a huge Linux fan and run <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> as my daily driver. My favourite programming languages are C++, Haskell, and Python. I am a huge fan of C++14 and can't wait for C++17 to come out. In my spare time, I like working on personal projects or playing piano. I can fluently speak English, French, Spanish, and Italian and I'm going to leave it at that because explaining why that is would take too long.</p>
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>In my spare time, I often work on various personal projects. Here is a list of my bigger programs.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Leonardo2718/Lepton_Editor">Lepton</a></h3>
        <p>Lepton is a small text editor written in C++ with <a href="http://www.qt.io">Qt</a>. It is based on the <a href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla/intro">QScintilla</a> editor library and uses a custom lexer for syntax highlighting. It supports syntax highlighting for various programming and markup languages including C++, XML, Python, and Haskell. It also supports some very basic project management and is highly customizable.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Leonardo2718/Quark_Note_Taker">Quark</a></h3>
        <p>Quark is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> based note taking program. It is written in Python and uses <a href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a>. It supports many features including: basic note management, syntax highlighting in the Markdown editor (using a custom lexer), spell checking, a live preview, synchronized scrolling of the editor and the preview, <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> support, code blocks, syntax highlighting for code blocks, custom CSS, custom HTML output templates, and exporting notes to HTML files.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Leonardo2718/OGLA">OGLA</a></h3>
        <p>OGLA is a generic C++ lexical analysis (lexer) library. It's intended for use in applications which require basic lexical analysis for simple tasks such as configuration file parsing and pretty-printing. It is based on regular expressions and allows grammars to be loaded dynamically. It is not intended to be a very fast lexer, but rather to be as generic and flexible as possible. The main implementation is completely stand-alone as it only uses the standard C++ libraries. However, there is also an alternative (and somewhat experimental) implementation that uses <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html">Boost Regex</a>, which is more powerful than the standard regular expression library.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Leonardo2718/tuc">tuc</a></h3>
        <p>tuc is a small, experimental, and primitive compiler. It is purely intended as an educational project. It has no real practical application other than being a fun environment for testing ideas and experimenting. It compiles a language I created called U (TUC obviously stands for The U Compiler).</p>
